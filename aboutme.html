				<h5> Up until I was six years old, I grew up in Anaheim, CA playing baseball, soccer, and basketball, before I moved out to Chino Hills and continued playing each sport. I attended St. Norbert's Elementary for K-1st grade, Butterfield Elementary for 2nd and 3rd grade, and O.P.A from 4th to 8th grade. Throughout the years, sports have always been a huge part of my life. I have never gone more than a month without playing a sport and without playing, I wouldn't be the same person I am today. The most memorable team I have played for was the Chino Hills Thunder, coached by my Dad, the toughest coach out there. On this team we were jokes, all messing around and childish in the dugout, but when it came time to play we won, constantly. We built ourselves up to winning a big Arizona tournament and coming back from 7-1 down, to placing 2nd in California. </h5>

				<center><h5> I currently play club soccer on Arsenal Pre-Academy out of Ontario. We played at Surf Cup on the weekend of July 28th and did well for a rebuilding team. I play center-back and on the team are other members of the Damien Soccer Team. </h5></center>

				<center><img src="blizzard.jpg" width="200px"></center>
				<center><h5> My favorite thing to do, other than playing soccer, is snowboarding. Usually during the Winter, I spend a weekend at my Big Bear cabin to snowboard. Although most people don't like falling, I find it one of the best parts of the sport because it teaches you and a little pain isn't so bad. However, in this picture I was in Mammoth with my friend Gianni, for one of the bes weekends I can remember. </h5></center>

				<center><h1>Photography</h1></center>
				<center><img src="pano.jpg" width="600px"></center>
				<center><h5> When I see the opportunity, I try and take good pictures and in Yosemite, I found opportunities everywhere. I began liking photography when my brother got interested because he bought a camera and started showing me the photos he took. Naturally, I had to take some of my own to top him, which I did with panoramas like this one. </h5></center>
